# Meeting with John Roman and Jack Agro

**Product idea:**  Develop a drone/submerisble which can fly to a
location, land on water and then submerge to a depth of (at most)
a few meters to collect a water sample, then surface and fly away.

We discussed the basic operation of a submarine with ballast tanks.
Then, realized that a drone is mostly open structure and likely to be
almost neutral-buoyancy without any special effort.

We discussed the idea of a tethered buoy for the radio antenna
while the vehicle is submerged.  Seems very complex given possible
interactions between the buoy and rotors.  An autonomous
submerge/surface cycle seems more realistic.

We discussed various ways to waterproof the electronics:

* Conformal coating.  Challenging for pre-packaged things like ESCs
  and radio receivers
* Potting.  (placing the components in a tray and covering them with a
  liquid plastic).  This seems feasible but relatively heavy.
* Vacuum sealed plastic bag.  Quite promising, but requires a working
  vacuum sealer.
  
I (Eric) agreed to do two things:

* Check in Physics to see if the vacuum sealer is still ther
* Inquire from Steve Chomyszak about the approval process and
  acceptance rate for the EPIC grants.
