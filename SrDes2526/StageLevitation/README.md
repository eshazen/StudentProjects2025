# Magic Lab 4 : Stage Levitation

## 2025-11-10

Met with Avery C.  They want to create the illusion of a person sitting
on a stool levitating.  They hope to do this with a linear actuator
hidden somehow in the leg of a stool.

They don't seem to have a good grasp of the mechanical issues involved.

For the electronics, they could use an H-Bridge to drive the 12V 5A
motor in the linear actuator from an Arduino.

We discussed extensively the mechanical issues, and also the power supply.
They wanted to power everything from a 25V LiPo battery in the seat.
I strongly encouraged them to initially use a 12V brick and then to
consider the battery option as an upgrade.

I also strongly encouraged them to prototype the mechanics and test it
with e.g. a scissors jack before dealing with the linear actuator.
