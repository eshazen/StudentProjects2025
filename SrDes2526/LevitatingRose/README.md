# Levitating Rose

Rose petals fall off rose and cascade down inside glass bell jar

## 2025-11-12 meeting

Prep:

My name is Anna Tretiakova and I am a student on the senior design
project 205: Levitating Rose.

In our project we will be using push pull solenoids to push petals out
of the rose bud and each one activates with 4 volts. I need some
guidance and help with making a transistor network similar to the one
in this youtube video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6VfPv5fOeM. Which is a demonstration
by Electronzap, in which a potentiometer sequentially activates
LEDs. In our application, solenoids will replace the LEDs, and as the
potentiometer value changes (this needs to be somehow added to a DMX
board) the transistor network will sequentially trigger each petal
solenoid, enabling precise, controlled petal releases. This network
will allow one wire to control all the petals instead of having 1 wire
control 1 petal.

Would it be possible for me to come to your office some time tomorrow
morning to tell you more about our idea, why we need this transistor
network and to get your opinion if this idea is possible?
